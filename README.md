## Overview of the Analysis

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
* Finally, I added these new visualizations to the two created earlier in the module for the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results

Below are the results of the analysis. Not picutred is the .ipynb file that was used to convert the tripduration column from an integer to a datetime datatype. This can be found here: [link to file] (https://github.com/AleksKostrycka/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb) A new CSV file was created with the change to the trip duration column which was then used to create all below visualizations. This file could not be uploaded to Git Hub becuase of the size of the file.
